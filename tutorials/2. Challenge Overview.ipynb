    "- **Dynamic Budget Management:**  \n",
    "  By relying on the most recent weight $\\mathbf{w}_{i-1}$, the model can efficiently re-assess the remaining budget and rebalance allocations as needed, even allowing for early termination if too much of the budget is allocated early in the process.\n",
