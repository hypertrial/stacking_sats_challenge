    "This notebook replicates the structure used by the evaluation engine to test all participant strategies. If your strategy passed all the tests in [Tutorial 3 Strategy Sevelopment Template](https://github.com/hypertrial/stacking_sats_challenge/blob/main/tutorials/3.%20Strategy%20Development%20Template.ipynb), it could still fail the tests here due to enviroment differences (different library versions). Which is why we strongly encourage participants to use a virtual enviroment while developing and testing their strategies.   \n",
