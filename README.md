# Stacking Sats  
Resources for Hypertrialâ€™s Stacking Sats Challenge

---

# ðŸ§  Challenge Overview  
Youâ€™ve been orange-pilled. Your mission? Stack as many sats as possible.

Most Bitcoiners rely on Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)â€”investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. It's simple, reduces timing risk, and avoids emotional investing. But is it optimal?

In this challenge, youâ€™ll go beyond static DCA to design dynamic accumulation strategies that aim to maximize Bitcoin holdings while keeping DCAâ€™s core strengths. Your goal is to refine your approach and build intuition around Bitcoinâ€™s unique structure.
