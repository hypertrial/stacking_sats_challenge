    "This notebook replicates the structure used by the evaluation engine to test all participant strategies. If your strategy passed all the tests in [Tutorial 4 Strategy Development Template](https://github.com/hypertrial/stacking_sats_challenge/blob/main/tutorials/4.%20Strategy%20Development%20Template.ipynb), it could still fail the tests here due to enviroment differences. Which is why we strongly encourage participants to use a virtual enviroment while developing and testing their strategies (complete [Tutorial 3. Virtual Env Setup](https://github.com/hypertrial/stacking_sats_challenge/blob/main/tutorials/3.%20Virtual%20Env%20Setup.ipynb) if you haven't already).   \n",

Or it may mean that your model's logic does not meet the criteria. We suggest going back to tutorial 3 and running your own set of tests to ensure the model is behaving as expected. "
